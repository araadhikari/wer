There was a frog.

The little boy and his dog were sleeping and the frog got out.

The boy woke up and the dog and the frog was gone.

He ran away.

He looked everywhere, but the dog got stuck in a jar.

The boy shouted.

And the dog still got it stick to its head.

He went outside to look for the frog.

I don't know what the next thing is.

Then something bit his nose.

And he looked for him.

In a tree. And he looked good. He went to the branch.

Then a branch- a deer.

And then they run.

And the dogs runs.

He put them down.

Then he, he hears a sound.

Then the, the boy said be quiet dog.

There was a frog inside there.

And the frog had a mommy.

And there was a little frog.

The little boy was so happy.

And the frog watched it.

The end.
