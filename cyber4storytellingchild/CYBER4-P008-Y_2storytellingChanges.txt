So the boy had a pet dog and a pet frog.

And the boy sleeped and the frog was jumping out.

And the boy was sad because the, the, the, the frog was leaving.

And the boy looked everywhere.

And the dog still have that jar on his head and the boy called out.

And, I don't remember this part.

He was looking at the woods and then that squirrel bite his nose.

And he looked everywhere and the walnut tree. And he hang on that. And it was a deer.

And the deer was almost to the cliff.

And, the walnut tree fall, I think.

And the deer let the kid and the dog fall.

And there was a log.

And, and the kid said, "Shh," to the dog and he looked, he looked through the other side and he saw the mom and the dad and they had little babies.

And they took one little baby frog. And there, and then they took home. The end.
