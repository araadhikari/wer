The frog jumped out of the can and they tried to find it but they fell in the water, and so they had to go and find it. They found it and put it back in the jar, and then they could be home and they wouldn't have.

The frog jumped out of the jar and when they woke up, he didn't see the frog so he went out and tried to find it and the moose brought him into the water.

The dog and the person was looking all over the place but they couldn't find it. At the end, they could find it.

The dog got his head stuck in the jar so he couldn't get it off of his head.

He was still calling for the dog- for the frog, so he kept on calling until at the end, they found him.

They had the moose carry the person and knocked them, the boy and him in the water.

He dropped them down with a big splash.

Then at the log, they went over and saw the frog. The boy said, told the dog to be quiet, and the babies came out and they saw a frog.

There was little frogs jumping out and one liked the boy so he brought him home for his new pet. The frog said goodbye to the boy and they happy.
