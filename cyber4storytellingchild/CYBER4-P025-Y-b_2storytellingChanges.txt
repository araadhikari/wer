 Frogs where are you.

It left to look the other frogs.

The frog got out.

The boy was looking everywhere.

And they called out.

Then he was calling out again.

And he was right there. He bit his nose.

And then he looked in there.

And then he climbed that.

And then the deer came out.

And then the deer went running.

And then I don't know what happened there.

And then they fell in the pond.

And then they saw the log.

Then the boy told it to be quiet. And they're looking behind. Then they found the frog.

Then that.

Then that.

Then end.
