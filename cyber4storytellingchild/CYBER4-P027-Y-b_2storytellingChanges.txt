It was about the frog that came out ... of the jar.

They were looking inside for the frog.

And then they went to sleep, and then the frog jumped out.

He then, the dog and the boy wook up and saw the jar.

And looked everywhere ... They didn't find it.

And then the boy was looking around and shouting out for the frog and also ... the dog had ... the bowl on some of his head, still.

Then, they were all, both calling out for the frog ... And then they looks ... They look in the woods.

And then the ... the squirrel  hit the nose ... And then the boy checked in a little hole.

And then, he was standing on a branch, and then he figured it out that it was ...

looked up

And then they were running around the end in the river.


And then they fell here.

... And then they heard a little voice ... And then the boy was, was saying to the dog, "be quiet." And then they jumped on and checked inside.

And then they found the frog.

... And then they found other frogs, too.

And they wanted to, to, to take it ... the little one, the little frog to take home.

And then they were looking ... so they could walk home. The end.
