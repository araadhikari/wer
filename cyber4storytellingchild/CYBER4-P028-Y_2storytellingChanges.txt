One day, a boy found a frog in the jar.

And then the boy fell asleep and the, and the frog went away.

And then the next morning, the boy woke up and he found the jar that was empty.

He looked everywhere but he didn't find the frog.

And the dog, the, a jar stuck in his head and he looked out the window with the jar stuck on his head.

He called out for his frog, but he still didn't find it.

He looked in the jungle but it wasn't there. He looked in the hole, but, but something came out of the hole and hurt his nose.

He looked in the hole, and held on the branches, and branches, but those are not branches. Those, that was a reindeer.

And then the reindeer held on, on to the boy. And then they were close to a hill and the reindeer was taking the boy close to the hill.

And then they fell into a pond.

And then, they fell in and then, next to a lily oad. And then they heard something. And then, the boy told his dog to be very, very quiet. They looked behind the log and they found two frogs.

And they had little tiny babies. And he found his, and he found his frog as a pet.

They, and the frog left home.
