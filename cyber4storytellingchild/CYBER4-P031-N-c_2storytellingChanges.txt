A little boy who had a frog.

When he fell asleep ...

The frog was jumping out of his jar.

The little boy woked up in the morning and saw that the frog has got out of his jar, and he was so sad.

He searched, and he searched with his dog. His dog got stuck in, got his head ... stuck in the jar.

Then he call out, "Froggy! Where are you?" And the dog did it too.

Then he called out again, "Little froggy. Where are you?"

Then he looked, and looked, and looked. But he came to ... a hive where bees were. Miss, Misses Bee wouldn't, was, was, was always grumpy and he bite the little boy's nose.

Then the boy climbed up through a tree, and to look inside, but the frog wasn't in there.

He called out again, "Little froggy, where are you?" And then he climbed up branches.

But they weren't really branches. They were really, antlers.

... The antlers picked the, the antlers picked up the little boy and ... then he, he didn't want to fall.

And then they were really branches.

And then the ... Then the ... I don't know what the end was.

... And ... And then ... Then the, the animal with the antlers took ... the little boy somewhere that he could get lost.

Then his dog came, and the little boy has fell.

In the, in the pond.

The boy got wet, and wet, and wet. And then the dog come on his head when he was felling into the pond.

Then he told the dog to be quiet, so the frog won't hear them.

Then when they looked down, they saw that the frog was there.

And then, the little boy found the frog and the mother frog ... They had little babies.

They had little baby frogs, and they were so cute ... The little boy asked the, the baby frog to be his new pet, and he did said yes ... And then the mother and the father and the other children ... wouldn't let their big sister have take care of the little ones.

And that's the end of the little boy has lost his frog.
