About a boy's frog and-

The frog got out.

And the boy, and the boy, he woke up the next morning he saw his frog was gone.

He was looking and he went for him.

He was calling out but the frog didn't answer.

He called again and then the frog still didn't answer.

So he looked and looked for him but he still didn't find him.

And then he found a creature in the  but the creature was mad and he bit his nose.

He looked and looked and looked in the tree but he still didn't find it.

Then he, he climbed on a rock and he hold branches and he called his frog and then he, those ... Branches were not branches. Those were antlers ... moose.

And the moose brought the boy into his head and brought him to the edge of the forest. And then the boy fell.

The boy fell in a splash ... Then he heard a noise.

The kid told the dog to be, be quiet ... They went over the log.

And they saw the frog.

Then he saw two little baby frogs.

And then the boy only wanted to keep one and they let him keep it.

And the frogs said bye.
