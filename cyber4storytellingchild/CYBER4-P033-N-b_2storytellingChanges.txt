It was about frogs.

They got lost and- They got lost and the little boy, and the little boy, got, got sad.

The ... the frog stepped out from the jar ...

And when the boy woke up, the frog was not here.

And was, and then he found a place but then he didn't put it on. But then the dog got wait, his head got stuck in the jar.

... And then the little boy screamed, but the dog still had the jar stuck on his head.

 The boy screamed even louder, and the frog didn't answer.

And then the boy found- and then the boy just left home-

And then the, the mouth, the, the ... the bunny bit his nose, and he was holding it becausehe bit him really hard, and then the dog found a nest. And then the boy found a little hole, but then he couldn't fit, so he thought the frog wasn't there.

But then he screamed even louder but there was a owl.

... And then the boy and the dog got stuck in the tree-

I mean, the bird got stuck in the tree. And then the kangaroo, the kangaroo carried him.

And then the ... and then the little boy went back home again.

... And then the dog and the boy got dropped down.

... And then the boy waved his hand and then the dog was scared.

And then the, the, the boy tells the dog to be very, very, very quiet.

And then it might be the frogs-

Right there-

And then the little, the little dog found the, the dad and the mom and baby- and little baby frogs.

And then the ... the, one of the frogs wanted to take him home because he liked the boy.

And then one, and then the other time, then the, the boy carried him home. And then ... and then there were the, the babies were all together now.
