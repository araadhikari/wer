A frog.

It got lost.

Well, he, lived in a jar.

Then he looking out.

Then he went back with a new frog and the dog.

It was so sad about those frogs.

When it was gone.

And then the dog still had the tank on his head. 

When he was shouting out for frog, he was getting so sad.

frog.

He is so mad because the animal bited his nose.

So now, he went up in a tree-

And tried to find frog.

He said, "Froggy, Froggy, Froggy!" And then he thought this, these were branches.

But it was a deer. He was so scared for the deer.

The deer carried both the dog and the boy ...

They fall over the edge, they land in the pond. They couldn't see the reindeer.

So now he's down in the pond, and he almost found froggy.

So, they looked over there and they hear, "Froggy! Are you there?" And then he jumped .

They swam around the log ...

And then they found froggy sitting at a swamp. They found babies with them, too!

And they thought that  , and next we can get all of them.

He said, "Ribbit". He said, "Bye, Toodles, bye! I'll always love you!"

And all of them were looking at him. And then they were so happy, they left one on the bottom . The End.
