The boy liked the frog.

The frog escaped when it was night.

When it was morning, the frog escaped. The, the frog was gone.

The, the boy looked the boy looked for the frog and the dog looked too. When, when he tried to look in the jar, he got his, head stuck in it.

They caught the yellow    from the, and then they called for the frog.

They looked in the forest, they looked in the forest and the boy asked an animal but the animal bit his nose.

They looked, they touched me, he, London went on a branch and he held on, he, he stood on a branch and he held on to a branch but the branch wasn't really a, a branch. It was deer antlers.

The deer picked him up and put him on his head. He carried him to the, to a cliff but then the deer stopped. The, the boy and the dog fell into the river and the boy and the deer dug over because the deer bent his head.

And the boy and the dog heard a familiar, sound. The dog, the boy told the dog to be quiet. They looked behind a log and, and they saw a frog and, and then the, the babies. The boy had found his pet.
