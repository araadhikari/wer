It was about a frog.

But he was ... But he climbed out of the ... He jumped out of the window.

He was living in there and then he went out the window.

Yes ...

And then they look for everywhere for his pet frog, but the dog ... They ... He looked in the jar, but he actually got stuck in here.



Then he looked everywhere for his pet. He looked outside for his pet frog and he saw ... He looked for his pet frog in the woods.

And then ... And then he asked a creature, but he bite his nose.

 Just like ...

And then he looked in a big, big, big, big tree log!

But then he saw ... That was ... That he climbed on a rock and he thought that was two branches so he wouldn't fall.

Then he got stuck on the deer's head. That's silly.

Picked him up on a cliff and he started running to it ... Started running and then he fall   and then splash! And then he's in the water, and then he heard a sound and he though that was his pet frog. The doggie extra quite.

He kind of bite me.

And then they look for him. And then they say the mother and the babies. Then he went back home.

Then they walked and then The End.
