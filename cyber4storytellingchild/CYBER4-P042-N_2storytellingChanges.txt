A frog.

In the woods?

The boy is looking for the frog?

They went over the side.

They were looking in the woods.

And then it bit him.

On the nose. He looked in the tree.

He thought ...

The moose stared running.

The kid and the dog fell into the lake.

The boy told the dag to be quite. He look on the other side and found two frogs.

Then baby frog were ... Then baby frog came around.

Jumping forward?

And it, and the other frogs looked at the boy taking the frog home.
