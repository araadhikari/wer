 there was a frog in a jar.

She ... it went to sleep and then the frog get out of the jar.

And then jumped away out of the window.

When ... when it's the morning they wake up but then they see the frog was not in the jar.

They looked everywhere but they can't see them. I mean they can't see the frog.

And ... and then the jar stuck ... and then the dog was stuck by the jar and then the boy called for the frog.

It called out all around and they can't find the frog.

They look in the woods but they can't find it.

They called every animals and then the animal just bit the boy's nose.

And then the animals why you covering ... covering your nose?

He climbed in the tree and see in the hole but there's no frog, there was not the frog.

He climbed in ... into the big rock and he hold the trunks and called out.

And it was not the bench, it was the ... it was the deer and then he put the boy on his head.

And then he run ... he run with ... with the dog and then they were close to the cliff.

The deer ... the deer stopped and then they put ... they put the boy down and then ... and then he splashed in ... in a pond.

Then they hear some ... a sound.

He said ... the boy said to his dog, "Shhh." He ... he get out of the log and see of the other side.

They saw the frog.

He saw the little frogs.

He ... the little frogs liked the boy.

And then it was ... it was his pet.

And then they looked at the boy take the pet. The end.
