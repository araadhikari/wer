 One day there was a boy and a dog and they had a pet frog.

one day while the boy and the frog were both asleep the frog got out of the jar and went out a open window.

When the boy and the dog got up, they didn't see the frog in the jar.

The boy looked all around his room. When the dog tried to look in the jar, his head got stuck in it.

The the boy called for his frog.

He went outside and called for the frog again.

When the boy asks the gopher, the gopher's grumpy so it bit him in the nose.

The boy climbed up a tree and looked in a hole for a frog.

He climbed up on top of a rock and held on to a branch so he wouldn't fall and called for his frog.

But this... the branches weren't really branches. It was a deer.

The deer started running. It stopped on the edge of a big hill. The deer stopped and the boy and the dog fell into a pond. Then the boy had a idea.

The boy told the dog to be quiet. They they climbed over the rock. They found um the boy's pet frog with a mother frog. And they had babies.

And one of the baby frogs followed him home.

And the other frogs watched as they went back home.
