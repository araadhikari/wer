There's a frog.

Then, the frog climbed out of the jar.

And then it was gone the next morning. And then, and then the boy lost him.

And then the jar got stuck on the dog's head.

And then, the boy cry over the frog.

And then they looked in the forest.

And then ... And-and-and then, a guy pinched and bites the-the boy's nose.

And then the boy looked in a hole in the tree.

And then he called out for it, the frog. And it was a deer.

And then there, they were, they ran off with the boy.

And-and then, they looked in the forest again. And then they fell into the water.

 And then ... And then they hear the familiar voice. And then the-the boy said, "Be quiet," to the dog.

Then, he looked behind a log and then there was a where the frog was.

and then they found him. And then they bringed the one home.

Then, they're away now.

That was the end.
