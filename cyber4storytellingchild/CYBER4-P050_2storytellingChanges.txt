So, there was a little boy and he had a dog and he had a pet frog.

And he kept the frog in a big jar.

And one night when he was sleeping, and so was his dog, the frog leapt out and leaped out of an open window.

And in the morning,

The boy woke up and he was like, "Where is the frog?" And...and then him and the dog searched everywhere. And when the dog looked in the jar, it got it's head stuck.

And then they both looked out the window and the dog still had the jar on his head. They went outside and called for the frog, they look...they called in the woods. The...look...the boy asked a animal and the dog and the animal bit his nose. He looked in a hollow in a tree.

He looked on a...he climbed up on to a rock and held some branches to keep him stable, but the branches weren't... branches. They were deer antlers and the deer picked up the boy on it's head and he ran to the... to... and he started running and with the dog they started running toward a cliff and the deer stopped. And the boy and the dog fell off the cliff and... they were one on another and luckily there was a pond underneath them and they fell down in a big splash. And then they...and they landed near a... log and heard a familiar sound. And the boy told the dog to be very quiet and they leaned over the log and they saw his frog with a very big mother frog and they had little baby frogs. And one leapt toward the boy, he liked the boy and wanted to be his new pet. And all the frogs watched as they went home.

, cute that froggy right there. That big...
