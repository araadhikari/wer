... bird, a butterfly and a dragon. The bird said, "I want to go for a fly." 
"I, I don't want to go for a fly," said the dragon.
I'll guess I will just go.
Hey, the butterfly said, "I wanna go get some honey."
Hey, I can.
I don't want to either.
The dragon said, "let's, let's go for a run."
I can't run, I can't run.
"Let's go for a fly," said, "let's go for a fly," said the ... said the ... butterfly.
No, I don't want to go for a fly. I want to go for a cheep, cheep, cheep.
"I can't cheep," said the dragon.
"I can't cheep either," said the butterfly.
Hey ... I see a cat coming along.
The cat said, "let's go for run."
Okay.
I can't run.
We'll just walk. We'll go slow.
Everybody was happy again. Happy ever after. The end.
Yep.
