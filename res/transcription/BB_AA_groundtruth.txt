Once upon a time there lived a prince and a princess and a crocodile, and they played, and one day the crocodile sneaked out, and he ran away, and the next morning the prince and the princess said, "Oh, crocodile, let's play," and they ... and they couldn't see anything. They tried to look for him everywhere, but they couldn't find him, so they gave up looking, and they told the king, and then the next morning they couldn't find the crocodile. The End.
Okay.
