... time, there was a girl, a dog, and a cat playing fetch and the dog got the ball two times and the cod, and the cat got it three time. The dog tried to catch the cat and the girl said, "stop," and the, and they stopped playing. And then a bird came and the bird said, "what are you playing?"
"We're playing fetch. Would you like to play?" said the girl.
And the bird said, "no, there's a dog and a cat."
So, the bird left 'til morning and the bird came back in next morning and the girl said, "you wanna play tag?" And the bird said yes. And the bird got in a cage and the bird said to the little girl, "why am I in a cage? I'm not supposed to be in here."
And the girl said, "so I could keep you safe from the dog and the cat before they eat you." And then the bird went back home until the very last day of his life and he, and then he told his mother and father ... And he told his mother and father about his new friends. The end.
Let go.
