And that's bird and a dragon, and butterfly. They were living and playing tag until the bird left for the winter. All the way to south, and came back, all the way back, in the spring, and they played tag until they saw- they met a new friend, the butterfly, and then they saw a new friend from their school, Nate the cat. His name was mad-andy. We were playing tag and the cat caught the bird, and the bird caught the dragon and the dragon swallowed the butterfly, and also it-, also it threw it out. The end. Do you like that one?
Yeah.
