One day they built a snowman. They, they went, they sneaked in Santa's sleigh and went to the North Pole. When they got there, a seal was behind the mountains. The penguin ... The penguins yelled and they showed them up on the way down. A snow monster appeared and the snow monster was named Bob. 
But does this snow monster look like a tooth?  Like a baby tooth?  I wonder why.
And he, and he showed them to his home. His home was a igloo. The penguins went in. They thought it was wonderful but there was no furniture. They went to the store and got furniture. The end.
Nice work.
