And a king and a princess ... A princess and a ... A princess and a king appeared. The crocodile, I knew that. The prince and the princess loved the crocodile so much that they wanted him to be their pet. He wanted to be their pet too. So the princess and the prince came inside with the crocodile. The castle was alive and the castle wanted them to go in. The end.
There is mountains far away. They tried to go over it, but they couldn't and they tried another way. And they could go that way, but the bridge broke. They couldn't go across, but they built a new one. It was not brown, it was pink.
Then a dragon appeared and the crocodile's name was Luke, what, nope. The crocodile's name was Frank, the prince's name was Luke, and the princess' name was Lana maybe. And a dragon appeared. His name was Ethan.  And they went over the hills. And they went back to the home. The end. We're done.
