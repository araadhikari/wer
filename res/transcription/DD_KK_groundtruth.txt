Once upon a time there was a girl.
And a tigger.
Once upon, upon a time there was a boy, his sister and their friend. They played in the park. They played ... with balls. Then ...  and then they played on the swing but the friend couldn't play on the swings cause there, there wasn't enough swings there was only two. Then they played on the slide. The brother couldn't play on the slide cause there was only two people could play on the slide.
Okay.
Then.
Okay then.
Then they played on the brick wall, they, then the sister couldn't play on the brick wall cause there was only two bricks for them to stand on. Then a dog appeared.

The dog chewed the balls. The dog chewed the string and the dog broke the slide, but the dog couldn't break the brick wall because it was too hard. And then, and then ... and then a net caught the dog ... The, the boy, the sister and the girl, and the friend were so sad they bring the dog home and they try to break the net open. And the boy was named Carlos, Sophia and Ava.
Carlos 
And they try to fix the net of the dog but they could and they did. And they went to bed but the dog couldn't go to bed. They, they went to bed by a good night song. The end. We're done!
