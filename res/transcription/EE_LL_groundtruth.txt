I'm ready now. Okay. Once upon a time there was a girl named Sophia and a dog named Nothing and a cat named Joseph. The dog wanted ... Nothing wanted to play with a ball, so they played with the ball. And then the cat wanted to play blocks, so they played with blocks. They was so happy. They played all day and night.
This is part number 2. They  they played until a bird appeared and then they played, and played, and played, and played, and played the whole week. And then the bird wanted to play with the ball and blocks. Again, they played with the ball and blocks. The so ... They so had ... so, so the ... Sophia give the, the, the bird a cage. The end. What ... guys we're done.
