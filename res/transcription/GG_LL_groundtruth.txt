There was Ben, Smashman, and excuse me, a butterfly.
No.
Was that Ben Smasher? No, that's Ben, that's smasher. Who's that?
That's...
David Ortez?
No.
Honey Badger.
Honey Badger, oh, pfft. Somebody said something, honey badger. It was honey, honey badger and dragon saw and Ben saw a flower
Gosh!
and he wanted to pick it, then he sneezed and then he almost sneezed, then he sneezed and then the butterfly got burnt, and then he ran around going "ahh, ahh, ahh!" And then ...
What about Smasher?
Smasher... is going to come ... and then
Do we get to see pictures?
What?
You got the picture of that has a C on it.
Pfft. And then, and then,
nothing
Honey badger rested on the rock and then
Psshh! He fell
And then, he, when he was ready, he went on the slide and then and then, when he was when he was done, and then run, and then dragon, and then bird picked the flower.
Pssh!
Flower, I mean,Smashman picked the flower for Ben, and then Ben, with his fiery breath, he fired up the swing chains, and then he went on a fiery swing and bird went flying over to the, the the giant, giant twisty slide went down and said "wee!" and then on the, on the up part he just jumped and flew off ...

And then he said "bye friends!" And that's it. No.
