And then it ran through school and peeked inside. He saw ... they saw... the cat saw classmates when ... and then he jumped back through the window when he got back to the living room then he ran to her room and then, and then, dressed up like human and jumped back out through the window. And when it got to the school, it said, it, it talked like a human. Try not to meow and the girl's really surprised, "Oh hello, are you a new classmate?" said the girl. "Yes,  said the cat.
The teacher had the cat and the girl sit together in the same spot and then they went back home. The cat ran through the window, pulled off his clothes and then very fast and, and, and when they did not look the dog did something. Actually that is not ... there's ... the dog was home, also. They saw a bluebird. The bluebird had strange wings. When, when, when, when the girl and the cats, went back to the room the dog did something very mean. He trapped the bird in the, in cage. When they, when the girl and the cat got back they said, "Oh no! What can we do?"
The dog said, "I can fix this." The end.
