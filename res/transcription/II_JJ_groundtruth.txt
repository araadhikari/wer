A turtle and a little squirrel. One day they went out to the park. When they got to the park, they found a carrot, a pond to swim in, and a few acorn trees. the rabbit found the carrot, and he took it home with her. The turtle found a pond just swimming, and he swam until the day ended. And the squirrel took some acorns off the few acorn trees, and they all went home. The end.
I like that. Note there, like if this just went into the rooms, someone, like the people who were storytelling, we got to see their story. We got to hear their voices. It would be fun, and then like at the end, they'd come in, and they'd say, like if you were telling the story, they'd say, "Aliyah's telling the story." And if I was telling the story, they would say, "Angelica's telling the story." Yeah. So when are they gonna come back in?
Are you done telling your story?
Yes.
All right.
It's a shorty.
Okay, let's switch seats.
Mine's kind of a shorty, too.
