Once upon a time, there was a mommy penguin named Flipper, a baby penguin named Sally, a snowman named Snow, and a seal named ... What's his name again? What was his name again? I think the seal was named ... ... Okay, I'll just name it Michael. Okay. And the seal was named Michael. They played all day. One day, they lost their home, and they were very sad. Then, the next day, they had to live under the ice. Then, the next day, a snow monster appeared, and the snow monster was looking for his house. I'm kind of making my story different. And then, they played his favorite game, tag. The snow monster was It. He got everybody. The first person he got was the mommy penguin, Flipper. The second was Sally, the third was Snow, and the fourth was Michael. They went under the water to play again, and then, when they got back, they found their house. They all lived happily ever after. The end.
