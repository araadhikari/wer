A squirrel, a turtle, and a bunny. They liked playing. They wanted to play everyday, but their mom and dad said no. One day the squirrel, the bunny, and the turtle found a meadow. They played in it all day.  Then they went home, and then they came back and they found a new meadow that had flowers. They played it in all day ,and then they went to bed.
Then, they came ... Then, the next morning, they came back to the meadow, and then, they found food. So, the turtle ate the apple and the watermelon. The squirrel ate the olives, and the bunny ate the carrot. The end.

All right, I heard a "the end."  All right, can you guys switch seats for me, please?
