There was a girl, a dog, and a cat. The cat was playing with the dog, and the cat said, "Let's ... let's go outside and play." The girl said ... But the girl yelled out to the pets, "Be careful, there's bees outside." So she opened the window, the window for them to go out. And they were kind of scared at first, 'cause they were a little bit scared of bees. So when they went back inside, they ... they played and played and played until it was bedtime. The end. Okay. Do we tell when we're done?
