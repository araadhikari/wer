one boy and two girls. There was a sister's brother and a sister's best friend. They were playing at the playground. The boy really wanted the yellow ball, but the girl and her best friend got it first. The boy said, "I really, really, want it." So, every time they switched and played new games, they switched the balls. But then, a dog appeared. They were so surprised, they jumped on the blocks and the balls. They were so happy, they just wanted to be friends. They wanted to take the dog home, but they couldn't. It wasn't their dog. It didn't have an owner. So they played with the dog all afternoon, then they went home. The end.
