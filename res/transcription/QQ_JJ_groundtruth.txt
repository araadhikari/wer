A big girl elephant and then they saw two balls, and then they played with the two balls. And then they went on the swing, and then they went home. The next day they saw a dog. The dog went on a swing, and then he went on a slide, and then he got trapped in a net, and then the three people had to play on their own. And then the dog won, and then the night got loose. The end. Done.
That was quick.
Yeah.
