I may want start over, is that okay?
Okay.
So once there was a turtle and a baby dinosaur and a big bird dinosaur. They wanna play outside and then they went in the water to play. And then they all playing, diving under the water and then it was snowing. Then the water turned into ice but the, the baby dinosaur and the big bird dinosaur and turtle got out. Then, went home and played.

No they got out.
