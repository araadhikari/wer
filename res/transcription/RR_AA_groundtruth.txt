Once upon a time, there was a cat named Natalie, a dog named Atticus, and a girl named Delilah Fay.
No, that ... that's a boy.
That's a girl.
That's a boy.   Boys look like that, too.
Well, I'm going to call her a girl. Once upon a time there was a cat, and a dog, and a girl named Delilah Fay.
And Natalie and Atticus.
Huh? That should-
What if there was just like a boy and a girl? You could name him Desmond or Atticus. You could name-
Stop! You messed up it again. Oh, come on. Once upon a time, there was a cat named Natalie, and a dog named Atticus, and a girl named Delilah Fay. They had fun with each other. Then, the dog wanted to play with the ball, and then the cat wanted to play with the blocks. They, the girl wanted to go outside with them. Then, a blue bird appeared. It was nice because they didn't know who that was, and it might have been a pet bird or a not-nice ...
You said "bud."
Bird is not bud. Is not a word. Bird.
Bud. You said burd.
Bird.
You said burd.
Burd, burd, bird, bur ur ur.
Not bur.
Bir. R.
Bird.
And then-
Okay.
A bird appeared.
Hey guys, I keep hearing bird, bird, bird out here, you guys telling your story?
Desmond keeps on messing me up!
Desmond, you've got to listen to her story. Your turn's next, okay? All right.
I was-  
Now let's try that again.
And then let's see who can go again.
Ah, no, you're just going to do your turn, and then you're going to do your turn next, okay?
  It's my first time first.
Then a bird appeared. They played together with each other, and they had fun with all of them. Then they, then they caught the bird because they didn't know who it was, it might have been a pet bird, a nice bird, or a bad bird. The end. We're done!
