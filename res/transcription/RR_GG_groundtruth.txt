And then they decide to walk. The mama's playing with the blue ball and the, and the dad is playing with the yellow ball and then the dad accidentally pushed the, the kid down with the weight of the ball  .
That is weird. And then the rainbow comes, right?

And then the rainbow appeared. It was awesome because they found a ... 2 balls, a treasure chest-
What's that?

That's a bathroom, I think. Okay, what's that?
The end. A rainbow.
