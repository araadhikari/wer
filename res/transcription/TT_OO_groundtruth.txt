Okay, so once there was a bird, a butterfly, and a dragon. And there were playing volleyball. They were all good because they could all fly, and they lived close to a house, and there was a lot of flowers around them. And then the bird hit the ball into the woods, and when the butterfly went to go get it, he didn't come back. And then the bird and the dragon went looking for him, and then they found him, and then they came back. And there was a cat there, and when the cat appeared there, he could jump, but he couldn't fly, so he wasn't that good at volleyball. They started to play again, and then a miracle happened, and the cat won. And then, it started to rain, and it rained on the butterfly, and the butterfly fell over. And then, the dragon burped out fire, but then the rain put the fire out. And then, the bird went back into the nest, the dragon flew far away, the cat went back to its house, and then ... But the butterfly just was laying there. The end.
